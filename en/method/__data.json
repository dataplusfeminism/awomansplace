Technological interventions sanctioned under the project include the deployment of facial recognition-enabled CCTV cameras, the provision of a ‘video surveillance system’ in railways, and the development of a ‘panic switch-based safety device’ for cars and buses for aiding women’s safety.","Between 2013-2018, the Nirbhaya Fund was severely underutilised, with no state using more than 50% of the funds available to it. Based on data from 28 April 2023 available on the \u003Ca href='https://wcd.dashboard.nic.in/'>Nirbhaya Dashboard\u003C/a >, we analysed that 46% of the Nirbhaya funds are allocated to surveillance and policing functions, with the remaining 35% allocated to survivor-centric assistance, 12% to legislative/judicial measures and only 5% to education/training for violence prevention. Moreover, the Nirbhaya Funds seem to utilise a conception of 'women' that doesn't explicitly include the needs and experiences of trans women. Data on the utilization of the Nirbhaya funds released in response to \u003Ca href='https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/1714/AS93.pdf?source=pqals#:~:text=Under%20the%20Nirbhaya%20Fund%2C%20upto,70%25%20of%20the%20total%20allocation'> a question asked in the Lok Saba on 8 December 2023\u003C/a> also shows that most of the funds are allocated to surveillance and policing functions.","17871466","Source: SHEKHAR YADAV/THE INDIA TODAY GROUP VIA GETTY IMAGES","— Why should we question state surveillance in the name of women’s safety?","Feminists situate surveillance in a long line of patriarchal management that seeks to police women's bodies, erase trans/queer bodies, stigmatise disabled bodies, and enforce gender norms that place cultural expectations upon cisgender women to behave a certain way. This often has the effect of normalising and worsening violence, as well as limiting women’s public mobility. For instance, in 2012, Odisha police installed two CCTV cameras on its beach in Puri outside a temple \u003Ca href='https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2012/Dec/07/cctv-cameras-removed-from-puri-beach-after-protests-by-women-431766.html'> 'to keep tabs on anti-social elements who troubled women visitors.'\u003C/a> Soon, however, the cameras had to be taken down after women in the area began protesting that they felt the cameras were intruding on their privacy when they were swimming.","Moreover, when surveillance is carried out using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Facial Recognition Technologies, as is being done under the Safe City project, it can be highly inaccurate and prone to bias for dark-skinned persons. This is dangerous when used for policing as it can lead to false identifications and false arrests. For instance, in 2018 an innocent man was held for 54 days in jail due to being misidentified. The public accuracy levels released by Delhi police have been characterised as \u003Ca href='https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/delhi-polices-facial-recognition-tech-at-80-accuracy-stokes-privacy-concerns-again/articleshow/93587861.cms'> 'far too low to ensure the accurate identification of individuals.'\u003C/a>","Given such evidence of the harms of surveillance, the massive capital investment allocated under the Safe City project for implementing surveillance infrastructure owned and operated by law enforcement raises concerns that motivated our research.","Surveillance is not always harmful. It can also be an empowering tool for marginalised communities as evidence of innocence in cases of false accusations or when police officials refuse to believe their testimonies and experiences of violence. For instance, in 2013, residents of Nalasopara, a Muslim-majority slum in Mumbai, \u003Ca href='https://www.magzter.com/IN/Anant_Media_Pvt_Ltd/Tehelka/News/33172'>voluntarily installed CCTV cameras\u003C/a> in their locality to expose false arrests of Muslim slum dwellers by the police during episodes of communal violence.","The issue of surveillance for the safety of cisgender women and trans/queer communities thus depends on context: Who is surveilling? Who is being surveilled? How much control do the surveilled have over their circumstances and data? There are no easy answers, and it is important to open up informed public discussions about it.","In this essay, we focus on the cities of Mumbai and Kolkata, to explore visions of a city where cis and trans women and all queer people truly feel safe. What would a safe city look like for them? And what role does surveillance play in this vision? Based on interviews with the grassroots organisations who are providing direct services and support to survivors, our project proposes where government funds should be allocated, beyond surveillance, to turn this vision into a reality. We end with a call to action for how you can support feminist initiatives for safe cities.","→","Chapter 2: What is women’s vision of a safe city?","Chapter 2"," What is our vision of a safe city?

Everyone agreed that there needs to be wider public discussion about the nuances of this complex issue, and that this discussion needs to involve grassroots communities, and not be limited to elite decision-making spaces.","'Look, there is space for surveillance in my imagination of a safe city. Violence has happened to me. I have been raped. So, if we can be empowered, then we can go and challenge the police to check the CCTV cameras in that area, because this has happened to me there. So, for this documentation, a CCTV camera is required. But we should see how much we can depend on it and how much we cannot depend on it.

The answer was a resounding \u003Cspan class='font-bold'>'NO.'\u003C/span>","So, where should government funds be allocated to create public spaces that match their imaginations of a safe city? People's responses highlight a holistic view of public safety in which various institutions and stakeholders need to work together to create safe cities.","1. Upgrade civic infrastructure","To create safer cities for women, public spaces need to be made accessible for everyone. This includes designing disability-friendly infrastructure such as including ramps, and making public buildings, toilets, and transport accessible to persons with disabilities. Designing for accessibility in this way has a 'curb-cut' effect by benefiting broader populations than intended. For example, curb cuts on sidewalks make it easier not only for persons with disabilities, but also for women pushing baby strollers, the elderly with walkers, or those rolling carts behind them. It also means ensuring streets are well lit.","'CCTVs can really help but even if there is a camera and there are no street lights then what will the camera capture? You won't feel safe standing there or walking through a lane.'","Supreet K. Singh,","Red Dot Foundation","It also includes making public transport safe and accessible for women. An example of this is the government of Karnataka's Shakti scheme which made public local bus fares free for women in 2023. Speaking of the Mumbai local, a research participant expressed,","'The women's compartment is a very, very special place for me. It makes the city safe for us. I have fought with people there, been dramatic there, sang songs there. So, that train, which runs through the night, I can’t tell you how much it means to me.'","Chayanika Shah,","Queer-Trans Feminist Educator, Researcher, Activist","Public spaces such as parks and streets need to be safe not only from 'stranger danger' but also need to be a space where women can find safety when they flee unsafe homes.","'I see so many times that some woman is sitting in public view and fighting with a guy. And he cannot touch her. He is not able to beat her. She has chosen this space as the space where she feels safe.'","Informal urban settlements, street-side shops and stalls, and hawkers, all allow for more varied interactions in public spaces and ensure that there are what scholar Jane Jacob calls “eyes on the street” which provide informal surveillance of the urban environment. Hawkers contribute to women's safety by bringing people onto the streets to buy their wares and adding to the street lighting with their stall lights. Yet recent state initiatives for gentrification have led to public spaces being cleared of such eyes on the street despite their clear benefits. The state is replacing natural, informal surveillance that works with digital surveillance that doesn't.","2. Expand public awareness & police sensitization","Changing prevalent social and cultural attitudes about gender and sex requires long-term investment in education and sensitization. Sex education classes should be mandated in public schools for students of all genders to learn about consent from a young age. Even outside of the formal education system, public awareness campaigns should be organised by the government to educate the masses about gendered violence and bystander interventions through campaigns and public art.","'If we are talking about technology to reduce violence and increase security, we can use public messaging. For example, smoking is injurious to health. Such messages come when we go to a theatre, when we turn on a TV channel. We can have similar campaigns against violence. Violence is also injurious to society and it also affects mental and physical health.'","Mina,","Kolkata social worker","The state’s service providers also need to be sensitised to gendered violence. Women and trans/queer people who face violence are often reluctant to file police complaints due to the fear of re-victimisation by police officers who are known to shame, disbelieve, dismiss, coerce, and re-traumatize survivors. An effective solution to this has been implemented by the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) which has instituted \u003Ca href='https://tiss.edu/view/11/projects/all-projects/special-cell-for-women-and-children-maharashtra/' >Special Cells\u003C/a > run by trained social workers in the police system for women survivors.","'If Nirbhaya Fund has to be utilised, then first teach the police personnel how violence against women is dealt with. First, sensitise them to what is patriarchy, what is violence against women. Otherwise, the police mostly ask questions to the survivors like, ‘Why have you come? All he did was slap you. He still loves you.' Most of the protection officers do not know that there are women-centric services available here. Violence against women has to be addressed, the Nirbhaya Fund has to be utilised, but it will not be done only by installing a CCTV. This will happen by addressing all the issues.'","Sakhi,","Moreover, street-level sex workers contend that CCTV footage is used by police officials to harass them and solicit bribes from their clients. They recommend that the police should be taught how to use CCTVs sensitively:","'We are not saying that if a CCTV is removed, security will increase. A CCTV should be there but its footage should be used properly. It is used in a bad way. Don't remove a CCTV, teach [the police ] how to use it.'","Bindu,","3. Provide survivor-centred healthcare and counselling","Institutions and mechanisms for providing preventive and responsive healthcare for women and trans-queer communities need to be strengthened. This includes integrating responses to gendered violence in existing health services for \u003Ca href='https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/searo/india/publications/violence-against-women--research-brief-10-09-21-final.pdf?sfvrsn=46854a22_4&download=true'>trauma-informed care\u003C/a > such as providing survivors with anonymity, along with treatment and first-line support. Healthcare also includes mental health services. Survivors should be provided with a confidential space to recover with support for counselling. This is especially important in shelter homes for survivors, which are presently in a poor state for counselling:","'There should be a specialist there. If you want to hire a counsellor by paying Rs. 2000, this is what you will get. What is the benefit of someone who does not have knowledge? It has no point.'","Asha,","Shelter homes themselves are being defunded by the state. In 2013, Garima Ghars (public shelter homes for transgender persons) began \u003Ca href='https://theprobe.in/stories/garima-grehs-crippling-government-stops-funding-for-trans-shelter-homes/' >shutting down\u003C/a > due to a lack of government funding, while the Nirbaya Fund continues to be underutilised and thousands of crores have been allocated to the installation of digital surveillance infrastructures.","4. Strengthen reporting mechanisms","Only 14% of women who experienced physical or sexual violence reported seeking help in \u003Ca href='https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr339/fr339.pdf' >2015-16.\u003C/a > Mechanisms for communicating complaints of gender-based violence should be strengthened to incentivise reporting. \u003Ca href='https://icallhelpline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/helpline-directory.pdf' >Helplines\u003C/a > are one such mechanism that social workers unanimously recommended:","'This case recently came from Delhi a few months ago that was suicidal. We talked to her over the phone. Then, we intervened and heard the matter. Right now, she is continuing her studies. That means she has returned to her normal life. So, it was very important that someone was there to listen to her. If any survivor gets this assurance, they get more strength to fight. This has been our demand for a long time: across India, a national helpline for women.'","The Mumbai police have \u003Ca href='https://mumbaipolice.maharashtra.gov.in/womensafety.asp' >the 103 helpline\u003C/a > which is meant to be a 24-hour helpline for crimes against women in Mumbai, but social activists in the city complain that it does not often work:","'Often times, it does not connect.

We should invest in the 103 helpline.'","Sabah Khan,","Feminist activist","Beyond helplines, Sakhi One Stop Centres (OSCs) were instituted by the government of India in 2015 to support women facing violence in private and public spaces.

Reinforce legal interventions","Budgetary allocations towards strengthening the implementation of legal interventions would help survivors of violence:","'Many Indian laws are very progressive.

One PLV in every police station. Tell them to listen to the women who go to them. Let us effectively use what already exists.'","6. Fund civil society organisations","Perhaps one of the most overlooked contours for budgetary allocations towards safe cities is the funding for grassroots civil society organisations working on gender-based violence:","'We go into the field and work. So that's why we should also receive some of that budget allocation. No one knows better than us what women want.'","Not only is participation from civil society organisations rarely sought by the government in tackling gender-based violence, the funding for these organisations is being actively cut through oppressive laws such as the India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA):","'Everyone has to be compliant with laws and policies governing the social sector. Unfortunately many NGOs are unable to cope with the same and lose their access to funding. The need of the hour is that the NGOs and Government join hands to eradicate these issues.

During July and August 2023, Radhakrishnan conducted ethnographic fieldwork in four cities covered by the Safe City project of the Government of India -- Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. In these cities, Radhakrishnan did semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with a total of 24 individuals across 10 grassroots civil society organisations in English, Hindi, and Bangla. These organisations included intersectional women’s rights NGOs, trans-queer NGOs, and sex worker led NGOs, all of which work with gender-marginalised communities at a grassroots level on tackling gender-based violence. Some research participants who preferred to remain anonymous have been referenced here by aliases.","Following the data collection, the interviews were transcribed and translated by Sunita Bhadauria, and the data was qualitatively coded and analysed by a team of researchers from the \u003Cb>MIT Data + Feminism Lab\u003C/b> -- led by Radhika Radhakrishnan with support from Bianchi Dy, Natasha Ansari, and Catherine D’Ignazio.","In January 2024, the team formed an Advisory Committee consisting of a \u003Cb>Mumbai-based committee (\u003Ca href='https://pointofview.org/'>Point of View\u003C/a >\u003C/b> and \u003Cb>\u003Ca href='https://reddotfoundation.org/'>Red Dot Foundation\u003C/a>)\u003C/b> and a Kolkata-based committee consisting of \u003Cb>three civil society organisations that chose to remain anonymous\u003C/b>. The advisory committee took a lead on iteratively deciding the format of the design, target audiences, and design principles.","With the committee’s inputs, Bianchi Dy led the design and web development of this website and a zine, with illustrations designed by Indu Harikumar.
