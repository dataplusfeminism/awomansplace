Upgrade civic infrastructure",para_1:"To create safer cities for women, public spaces need to be made accessible for everyone. This includes designing disability-friendly infrastructure such as including ramps, and making public buildings, toilets, and transport accessible to persons with disabilities. Designing for accessibility in this way has a 'curb-cut' effect by benefiting broader populations than intended. For example, curb cuts on sidewalks make it easier not only for persons with disabilities, but also for women pushing baby strollers, the elderly with walkers, or those rolling carts behind them. It also means ensuring streets are well lit.",quote_1:"'CCTVs can really help but even if there is a camera and there are no street lights then what will the camera capture?

Hawkers contribute to women's safety by bringing people onto the streets to buy their wares and adding to the street lighting with their stall lights.

Expand public awareness & police sensitization",para_1:"Changing prevalent social and cultural attitudes about gender and sex requires long-term investment in education and sensitization.

Women and trans/queer people who face violence are often reluctant to file police complaints due to the fear of re-victimisation by police officers who are known to shame, disbelieve, dismiss, coerce, and re-traumatize survivors. An effective solution to this has been implemented by the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) which has instituted <a href='https://tiss.edu/view/11/projects/all-projects/special-cell-for-women-and-children-maharashtra/' >Special Cells</a > run by trained social workers in the police system for women survivors.",quote_2:"'If Nirbhaya Fund has to be utilised, then first teach the police personnel how violence against women is dealt with. First, sensitise them to what is patriarchy, what is violence against women. Otherwise, the police mostly ask questions to the survivors like, ‘Why have you come? All he did was slap you. He still loves you.' Most of the protection officers do not know that there are women-centric services available here.
