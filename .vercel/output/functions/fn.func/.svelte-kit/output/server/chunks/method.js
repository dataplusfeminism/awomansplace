During July and August 2023, Radhakrishnan conducted ethnographic fieldwork in four cities covered by the Safe City project of the Government of India -- Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. In these cities, Radhakrishnan did semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with a total of 24 individuals across 10 grassroots civil society organisations in English, Hindi, and Bangla. These organisations included intersectional women’s rights NGOs, trans-queer NGOs, and sex worker led NGOs, all of which work with gender-marginalised communities at a grassroots level on tackling gender-based violence. Some research participants who preferred to remain anonymous have been referenced here by aliases.";
const para_5 = "Following the data collection, the interviews were transcribed and translated by Sunita Bhadauria, and the data was qualitatively coded and analysed by a team of researchers from the <b>MIT Data + Feminism Lab</b> -- led by Radhika Radhakrishnan with support from Bianchi Dy, Natasha Ansari, and Catherine D’Ignazio.";

The advisory committee took a lead on iteratively deciding the format of the design, target audiences, and design principles.";
