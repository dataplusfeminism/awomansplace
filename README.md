# Locale-router
This app shows how to integrate locale routing using dynamic adapters (e.g. `@sveltejs/adapter-node`). It includes two pages and three language mutations (`en`, `de`, `cs`). Error pages are included as well.

## Setup

### `./src/hooks.server.js`
Takes care about redirects to appropriate language mutation.
