Technological interventions sanctioned under the project include the deployment of facial recognition-enabled CCTV cameras, the provision of a ‘video surveillance system’ in railways, and the development of a ‘panic switch-based safety device’ for cars and buses for aiding women’s safety.","Between 2013-2018, the Nirbhaya Fund was severely underutilised, with no state using more than 50% of the funds available to it. Based on data from 28 April 2023 available on the \u003Ca href='https://wcd.dashboard.nic.in/'>Nirbhaya Dashboard\u003C/a >, we analysed that 46% of the Nirbhaya funds are allocated to surveillance and policing functions, with the remaining 35% allocated to survivor-centric assistance, 12% to legislative/judicial measures and only 5% to education/training for violence prevention. Moreover, the Nirbhaya Funds seem to utilise a conception of 'women' that doesn't explicitly include the needs and experiences of trans women. Data on the utilization of the Nirbhaya funds released in response to \u003Ca href='https://sansad.in/getFile/loksabhaquestions/annex/1714/AS93.pdf?source=pqals#:~:text=Under%20the%20Nirbhaya%20Fund%2C%20upto,70%25%20of%20the%20total%20allocation'> a question asked in the Lok Saba on 8 December 2023\u003C/a> also shows that most of the funds are allocated to surveillance and policing functions.","17871466","Source: SHEKHAR YADAV/THE INDIA TODAY GROUP VIA GETTY IMAGES","— Why should we question state surveillance in the name of women’s safety?","Feminists situate surveillance in a long line of patriarchal management that seeks to police women's bodies, erase trans/queer bodies, stigmatise disabled bodies, and enforce gender norms that place cultural expectations upon cisgender women to behave a certain way. This often has the effect of normalising and worsening violence, as well as limiting women’s public mobility. For instance, in 2012, Odisha police installed two CCTV cameras on its beach in Puri outside a temple \u003Ca href='https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2012/Dec/07/cctv-cameras-removed-from-puri-beach-after-protests-by-women-431766.html'> 'to keep tabs on anti-social elements who troubled women visitors.'\u003C/a> Soon, however, the cameras had to be taken down after women in the area began protesting that they felt the cameras were intruding on their privacy when they were swimming.","Moreover, when surveillance is carried out using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Facial Recognition Technologies, as is being done under the Safe City project, it can be highly inaccurate and prone to bias for dark-skinned persons. This is dangerous when used for policing as it can lead to false identifications and false arrests. For instance, in 2018 an innocent man was held for 54 days in jail due to being misidentified. The public accuracy levels released by Delhi police have been characterised as \u003Ca href='https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/delhi-polices-facial-recognition-tech-at-80-accuracy-stokes-privacy-concerns-again/articleshow/93587861.cms'> 'far too low to ensure the accurate identification of individuals.'\u003C/a>","Given such evidence of the harms of surveillance, the massive capital investment allocated under the Safe City project for implementing surveillance infrastructure owned and operated by law enforcement raises concerns that motivated our research.","Surveillance is not always harmful. It can also be an empowering tool for marginalised communities as evidence of innocence in cases of false accusations or when police officials refuse to believe their testimonies and experiences of violence. For instance, in 2013, residents of Nalasopara, a Muslim-majority slum in Mumbai, \u003Ca href='https://www.magzter.com/IN/Anant_Media_Pvt_Ltd/Tehelka/News/33172'>voluntarily installed CCTV cameras\u003C/a> in their locality to expose false arrests of Muslim slum dwellers by the police during episodes of communal violence.","The issue of surveillance for the safety of cisgender women and trans/queer communities thus depends on context: Who is surveilling? Who is being surveilled? How much control do the surveilled have over their circumstances and data? There are no easy answers, and it is important to open up informed public discussions about it.","In this essay, we focus on the cities of Mumbai and Kolkata, to explore visions of a city where cis and trans women and all queer people truly feel safe. What would a safe city look like for them? And what role does surveillance play in this vision? Based on interviews with the grassroots organisations who are providing direct services and support to survivors, our project proposes where government funds should be allocated, beyond surveillance, to turn this vision into a reality. We end with a call to action for how you can support feminist initiatives for safe cities.","→","Chapter 2: What is women’s vision of a safe city?","Chapter 2"," What is our vision of a safe city?

Everyone agreed that there needs to be wider public discussion about the nuances of this complex issue, and that this discussion needs to involve grassroots communities, and not be limited to elite decision-making spaces.","'Look, there is space for surveillance in my imagination of a safe city. Violence has happened to me. I have been raped. So, if we can be empowered, then we can go and challenge the police to check the CCTV cameras in that area, because this has happened to me there. So, for this documentation, a CCTV camera is required. But we should see how much we can depend on it and how much we cannot depend on it. There should be more discussion and debate for this, only then we can find a solution.'","Bindu","Trans sex worker","← ","→ ","Chapter 3","Turning our vision of a safe city into reality","According to the data released by the government of India, 46% of the Nirbhaya funds are allocated to surveillance and policing functions. We asked social workers, women’s rights groups, and trans-queer activists, 'Does this allocation reflect the needs of women and gender minorities?' The answer was a resounding \u003Cspan class='font-bold'>'NO.'\u003C/span>","So, where should government funds be allocated to create public spaces that match their imaginations of a safe city? People's responses highlight a holistic view of public safety in which various institutions and stakeholders need to work together to create safe cities.","1. Upgrade civic infrastructure","To create safer cities for women, public spaces need to be made accessible for everyone. This includes designing disability-friendly infrastructure such as including ramps, and making public buildings, toilets, and transport accessible to persons with disabilities. Designing for accessibility in this way has a 'curb-cut' effect by benefiting broader populations than intended. For example, curb cuts on sidewalks make it easier not only for persons with disabilities, but also for women pushing baby strollers, the elderly with walkers, or those rolling carts behind them. It also means ensuring streets are well lit.","'CCTVs can really help but even if there is a camera and there are no street lights then what will the camera capture? You won't feel safe standing there or walking through a lane.'","Supreet K. Singh,","Red Dot Foundation","It also includes making public transport safe and accessible for women. An example of this is the government of Karnataka's Shakti scheme which made public local bus fares free for women in 2023. Speaking of the Mumbai local, a research participant expressed,","'The women's compartment is a very, very special place for me. It makes the city safe for us. I have fought with people there, been dramatic there, sang songs there. So, that train, which runs through the night, I can’t tell you how much it means to me.'","Chayanika Shah,","Queer-Trans Feminist Educator, Researcher, Activist","Public spaces such as parks and streets need to be safe not only from 'stranger danger' but also need to be a space where women can find safety when they flee unsafe homes.","'I see so many times that some woman is sitting in public view and fighting with a guy. And he cannot touch her. He is not able to beat her. She has chosen this space as the space where she feels safe.'","Informal urban settlements, street-side shops and stalls, and hawkers, all allow for more varied interactions in public spaces and ensure that there are what scholar Jane Jacob calls “eyes on the street” which provide informal surveillance of the urban environment. Hawkers contribute to women's safety by bringing people onto the streets to buy their wares and adding to the street lighting with their stall lights. Yet recent state initiatives for gentrification have led to public spaces being cleared of such eyes on the street despite their clear benefits. The state is replacing natural, informal surveillance that works with digital surveillance that doesn't.","2. Expand public awareness & police sensitization","Changing prevalent social and cultural attitudes about gender and sex requires long-term investment in education and sensitization. Sex education classes should be mandated in public schools for students of all genders to learn about consent from a young age. Even outside of the formal education system, public awareness campaigns should be organised by the government to educate the masses about gendered violence and bystander interventions through campaigns and public art.","'If we are talking about technology to reduce violence and increase security, we can use public messaging. For example, smoking is injurious to health. Such messages come when we go to a theatre, when we turn on a TV channel. We can have similar campaigns against violence. Violence is also injurious to society and it also affects mental and physical health.'","Mina,","Kolkata social worker","The state’s service providers also need to be sensitised to gendered violence. Women and trans/queer people who face violence are often reluctant to file police complaints due to the fear of re-victimisation by police officers who are known to shame, disbelieve, dismiss, coerce, and re-traumatize survivors. An effective solution to this has been implemented by the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) which has instituted \u003Ca href='https://tiss.edu/view/11/projects/all-projects/special-cell-for-women-and-children-maharashtra/' >Special Cells\u003C/a > run by trained social workers in the police system for women survivors.","'If Nirbhaya Fund has to be utilised, then first teach the police personnel how violence against women is dealt with. First, sensitise them to what is patriarchy, what is violence against women. Otherwise, the police mostly ask questions to the survivors like, ‘Why have you come? All he did was slap you. He still loves you.' Most of the protection officers do not know that there are women-centric services available here. Violence against women has to be addressed, the Nirbhaya Fund has to be utilised, but it will not be done only by installing a CCTV. This will happen by addressing all the issues.'","Sakhi,","Moreover, street-level sex workers contend that CCTV footage is used by police officials to harass them and solicit bribes from their clients. They recommend that the police should be taught how to use CCTVs sensitively:","'We are not saying that if a CCTV is removed, security will increase. A CCTV should be there but its footage should be used properly. It is used in a bad way. Don't remove a CCTV, teach [the police ] how to use it.'","Bindu,","3. Provide survivor-centred healthcare and counselling","Institutions and mechanisms for providing preventive and responsive healthcare for women and trans-queer communities need to be strengthened. This includes integrating responses to gendered violence in existing health services for \u003Ca href='https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/searo/india/publications/violence-against-women--research-brief-10-09-21-final.pdf?sfvrsn=46854a22_4&download=true'>trauma-informed care\u003C/a > such as providing survivors with anonymity, along with treatment and first-line support. Healthcare also includes mental health services. Survivors should be provided with a confidential space to recover with support for counselling. This is especially important in shelter homes for survivors, which are presently in a poor state for counselling:","'There should be a specialist there. If you want to hire a counsellor by paying Rs. 2000, this is what you will get. What is the benefit of someone who does not have knowledge? It has no point.'","Asha,","Shelter homes themselves are being defunded by the state. In 2013, Garima Ghars (public shelter homes for transgender persons) began \u003Ca href='https://theprobe.in/stories/garima-grehs-crippling-government-stops-funding-for-trans-shelter-homes/' >shutting down\u003C/a > due to a lack of government funding, while the Nirbaya Fund continues to be underutilised and thousands of crores have been allocated to the installation of digital surveillance infrastructures.","4. Strengthen reporting mechanisms","Only 14% of women who experienced physical or sexual violence reported seeking help in \u003Ca href='https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr339/fr339.pdf' >2015-16.\u003C/a > Mechanisms for communicating complaints of gender-based violence should be strengthened to incentivise reporting. \u003Ca href='https://icallhelpline.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/helpline-directory.pdf' >Helplines\u003C/a > are one such mechanism that social workers unanimously recommended:","'This case recently came from Delhi a few months ago that was suicidal. We talked to her over the phone. Then, we intervened and heard the matter. Right now, she is continuing her studies. That means she has returned to her normal life. So, it was very important that someone was there to listen to her. If any survivor gets this assurance, they get more strength to fight. This has been our demand for a long time: across India, a national helpline for women.'","The Mumbai police have \u003Ca href='https://mumbaipolice.maharashtra.gov.in/womensafety.asp' >the 103 helpline\u003C/a > which is meant to be a 24-hour helpline for crimes against women in Mumbai, but social activists in the city complain that it does not often work:","'Often times, it does not connect.

We should invest in the 103 helpline.'","Sabah Khan,","Feminist activist","Beyond helplines, Sakhi One Stop Centres (OSCs) were instituted by the government of India in 2015 to support women facing violence in private and public spaces.

And do you know how many cases one can take care of at any one point - one or two people at the most.'","Because official reporting mechanisms are inadequate, organisations like Safecity are trying to bridge the gap between the reality of sexual violence and the reported cases with the authorities, by inviting people to share their experiences anonymously on a website and app. Ms. Singh continues, \u003Cspan class='inline-quote'> 'It is important that this information goes out to every woman in the city.'\u003C/span >","5. Reinforce legal interventions","Budgetary allocations towards strengthening the implementation of legal interventions would help survivors of violence:","'Many Indian laws are very progressive.

One PLV in every police station. Tell them to listen to the women who go to them. Let us effectively use what already exists.'","6. Fund civil society organisations","Perhaps one of the most overlooked contours for budgetary allocations towards safe cities is the funding for grassroots civil society organisations working on gender-based violence:","'We go into the field and work. So that's why we should also receive some of that budget allocation. No one knows better than us what women want.'","Not only is participation from civil society organisations rarely sought by the government in tackling gender-based violence, the funding for these organisations is being actively cut through oppressive laws such as the India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA):","'Everyone has to be compliant with laws and policies governing the social sector. Unfortunately many NGOs are unable to cope with the same and lose their access to funding. The need of the hour is that the NGOs and Government join hands to eradicate these issues.

पितृसत्तात्मक प्रबंधन के लंबे इतिहास के हिस्से के रूप में देखते हैं, जो महिलाओं के शरीर को नियंत्रित करने, ट्रांस/क्वीयर शरीर को मिटाने, विकलांग शरीर को शर्मिंदा करने और जेंडर संबंधी आदर्शों को लागू करने का प्रयास करता है, जो सिजेंडर महिलाओं पर एक निश्चित तरीके से व्यवहार करने के लिए सांस्कृतिक अपेक्षाएं रखता है। अक्सर इसका प्रभाव हिंसा को आम बात बनाने और उसे बदतर बनाने के साथ-साथ महिलाओं की सार्वजनिक आवाजाही को सीमित करने का पड़ता है। उदाहरण के लिए, 2012 में, ओडिशा पुलिस ने पुरी में अपने समुद्र तट पर एक मंदिर के बाहर \u003Ca href='https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2012/Dec/07/cctv-cameras-removed-from-puri-beach-after-protests-by-women-431766.html'>'महिला आगंतुकों को परेशान करने वाले असामाजिक तत्वों पर नज़र

(प्राइवेसी)  में दखल दे रहे थे।","- हमें महिला सुरक्षा के नाम पर राज्य की निगरानी पर सवाल क्यों उठाना चाहिए?","इसके अलावा, जब आर्टिफिशियल इंटेलिजेंस (AI) फेशियल रिकॉग्निशन (चेहरे पहचानने वाली) टेक्नोलॉजीज का उपयोग करके निगरानी की जाती है, जैसा कि सेफ सिटी प्रोजेक्ट के तहत किया जा रहा है, तो यह बहुत ही गलत हो सकता है और सांवली त्वचा वाले व्यक्तियों के लिए भेदभावपूर्ण हो सकता है। पुलिसिंग के लिए उपयोग किए जाने पर यह खतरनाक है क्योंकि इससे गलत पहचान और झूठी गिरफ्तारियां हो सकती हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, 2018 में एक निर्दोष व्यक्ति को गलत पहचान के कारण 54 दिनों तक जेल में रखा गया था। दिल्ली पुलिस द्वारा जारी किए गए सार्वजनिक सटीकता स्तर को \u003Ca

करने के लिए बहुत कम'\u003C/a> बताया गया है।","चूंकि इस बात के पर्याप्त प्रमाण हैं कि निगरानी हानिकारक है, इसलिए निगरानी संबंधी बुनियादी ढांचे की स्थापना के लिए सेफ सिटी प्रोजेक्ट पर भारी मात्रा में धन खर्च किया जा रहा है, जिसका स्वामित्व और संचालन पुलिस के पास है, जिससे हम चिंतित हैं, और इसी वजह ने हमारे शोध को प्रेरित किया।","निगरानी हमेशा हानिकारक नहीं होती। झूठे आरोपों के मामलों में या जब पुलिस अधिकारी उनकी गवाही और हिंसा के अनुभवों पर विश्वास करने से इनकार करते हैं तो यह हाशिए पर रहने वाले समुदायों के लिए निर्दोष होने के सबूत के रूप में एक सशक्त उपकरण भी हो सकता है। उदाहरण के लिए, 2013 में, मुंबई की मुस्लिम बहुल झुग्गी बस्ती नालासोपारा के निवासियों ने सांप्रदायिक हिंसा की घटनाओं के दौरान पुलिस द्वारा मुस्लिम झुग्गीवासियों की झूठी गिरफ्तारी को उजागर करने के लिए \u003Ca

निगरानी का मुद्दा इस संदर्भ पर निर्भर करता है कि: निगरानी कौन कर रहा है? किसकी निगरानी की जा रही है? सर्वेक्षणकर्ताओं का अपनी परिस्थितियों और डेटा पर कितना नियंत्रण है? इसका कोई आसान उत्तर नहीं है, और इसके बारे में जानकारीपूर्ण सार्वजनिक चर्चा करना महत्वपूर्ण है।","इस निबंध में, हम मुंबई और कोलकाता शहरों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करते हैं, ताकि एक ऐसे शहर की कल्पना की जा सके जहाँ सिस और ट्रांस महिलाएं और

साथ साक्षात्कार के आधार पर, हमारा प्रोजेक्ट यह सुझाव देता है कि इस लक्ष्य को साकार करने के लिए सरकारी धन को निगरानी के अलावा अन्य चीजों पर खर्च किया जाना चाहिए। हम एक कार्यवाही के आह्वान के साथ समापन

ज़रूरत है।","1. नागरिक बुनियादी ढांचे को बेहतर (अपग्रेड) करना","महिलाओं के लिए सुरक्षित शहर बनाने के लिए सार्वजनिक स्थानों को सभी के लिए सुलभ बनाने की ज़रूरत है। इसमें विकलांगता-अनुकूल बुनियादी ढांचे को डिज़ाइन करना जैसे रैंप शामिल करना, और सार्वजनिक इमारतों, शौचालयों और परिवहन को विकलांग व्यक्तियों के लिए सुलभ बनाना शामिल है। पहुँच की सुविधा के लिए इस तरह के डिज़ाइन का 'अंकुश कटौती (कर्ब-कट)' प्रभाव होता है, जिसका अर्थ है कि यह जितना सोचा गया था उससे अधिक लोगों की मदद करता है। उदाहरण के लिए, फुटपाथ से सड़क तक एक छोटा सा रैंप या ढलान (कर्ब-कट) न केवल विकलांग लोगों के लिए बल्कि बच्चों की गाड़ी लेकर चलने वाली महिलाओं, पैदल चलने वाले बुजुर्गों और अपने पीछे गाड़ी खींचकर चलने वाले लोगों के लिए भी आसान बनाते हैं। इसके अलावा, इसमें यह सुनिश्चित करना भी शामिल है कि सड़कें पर्याप्त रूप से रोशन हों।","“सीसीटीवी वास्तव में मदद कर सकते हैं लेकिन अगर कैमरा है और सड़क पर लाइटें नहीं हैं तो कैमरा क्या रिकॉर्ड करेगा? आप वहाँ खड़े रहने या किसी गली में चलकर जाने में सुरक्षित महसूस नहीं करेंगे।“","सुप्रीत के. सिंह,","रेड डॉट फाउंडेशन","इसमें सार्वजनिक परिवहन को महिलाओं के लिए सुरक्षित और सुलभ बनाना भी शामिल है। इसका एक उदाहरण कर्नाटक सरकार की शक्ति योजना है जिसने 2023 में महिलाओं के

सुरक्षित बनाता है। मैंने वहाँ लोगों से लड़ाई की है, वहाँ ड्रामा दिखाया है, वहाँ गाने गाए हैं। तो, वह ट्रेन, जो रात भर चलती है, मैं आपको बता नहीं सकती कि यह मेरे लिए कितना मायने रखती है।”","चयनिका शाह,","क्वीयर-ट्रांस फेमिनिस्ट एजुकेटर, शोधकर्ता, कार्यकर्ता","स्थान भी होना चाहिए जहाँ महिलाएं असुरक्षित घरों से भागते समय सुरक्षा पा सकें।","“मैंने कई बार देखा है कि कोई महिला खुलेआम बैठी है और किसी लड़के से लड़ रही है। और वह उसे छू नहीं सकता। वह उसे मार नहीं पा रहा है। उसने इस स्थान को ऐसे स्थान के रूप में चुना है जहाँ वह सुरक्षित महसूस करती है।”","क्वीयर-ट्रांस फेमिनिस्ट एजुकेटर, शोधकर्ता,

महिलाओं की सुरक्षा में योगदान देते हैं। लेकिन सरकार द्वारा हाल ही में किए गए सभ्य बनाने के प्रयासों का मतलब यह है कि सड़कों पर नज़र रखने वाली ये आँखें सार्वजनिक स्थानों से हट गई हैं, हालांलाँ यह स्पष्ट है कि वे मददगार हैं। सरकार द्वारा प्राकृतिक, अनौपचारिक निगरानी, ​​जो काम करती है, के स्थान पर डिजिटल निगरानी का प्रयोग किया जा रहा है, जो काम नहीं करती।","2. जन जागरूकता और पुलिस संवेदनशीलता का विस्तार करना","जेंडर और जेंडर के बारे में प्रचलित सामाजिक और सांस्कृतिक नज़रिये को बदलने के लिए शिक्षा और संवेदनशीलता में लंबे समय के निवेश की ज़रूरत है। सभी जेंडरों के छात्रों को कम उम्र से ही सहमति के बारे में सीखने के लिए सार्वजनिक स्कूलों में यौन शिक्षा कक्षाएं अनिवार्य की जानी चाहिए। औपचारिक शिक्षा प्रणाली के बाहर भी, सरकार द्वारा अभियानों और सार्वजनिक कला के माध्यम से जेंडर प्रेरित हिंसा और देखने वालों के हस्तक्षेप के बारे में जनता को शिक्षित करने के लिए जन जागरूकता अभियान आयोजित किए जाने चाहिए।","“अगर हम हिंसा को कम करने और सुरक्षा बढ़ाने के लिए टेक्नालजी के बारे में बात कर रहे हैं, तो हम सार्वजनिक संदेश (मेसेजिंग) का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, धूम्रपान स्वास्थ्य के लिए हानिकारक है। ऐसे संदेश तब आते हैं जब हम किसी थिएटर में जाते हैं, जब हम टीवी चैनल चालू करते हैं। हम हिंसा के खिलाफ इसी तरह के अभियान चला सकते हैं।' हिंसा भी समाज के लिए हानिकारक है और यह मानसिक और शारीरिक स्वास्थ्य को भी प्रभावित करती है”","मीना,","कोलकाता सामाजिक कार्यकर्ता","सरकार के सेवा प्रदाताओं को भी जेंडर प्रेरित हिंसा के प्रति संवेदनशील बनाने की ज़रूरत है। हिंसा का सामना करने वाली महिलाएं और ट्रांस/क्वीयर लोग अक्सर पुलिस अधिकारियों द्वारा दोबारा पीड़ित होने के डर से पुलिस में शिकायत दर्ज कराने से हिचकते हैं, जो हिंसा से बचकर आए लोगों को शर्मिंदा करने, अविश्वास करने, खारिज करने, जबरदस्ती करने और फिर से आघात पहुँचाने के लिए जाने जाते हैं। इसका एक प्रभावी समाधान टाटा इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ सोशल साइंस

आए लोगों से सवाल पूछती है, 'तुम क्यों आए हो? उसने बस तुम्हें थप्पड़ ही तो मारा था। वो अब भी तुमसे प्यार करता है।' अधिकांश संरक्षण अधिकारियों को यह नहीं पता कि यहाँ महिला केंद्रित सेवाएं उपलब्ध हैं। महिलाओं के खिलाफ हिंसा को संबोधित करना होगा, निर्भया फंड का उपयोग करना होगा, लेकिन यह केवल सीसीटीवी लगाने से नहीं होगा। यह सभी मुद्दों को संबोधित करने से होगा।” ","सखी,"," कोलकाता सामाजिक कार्यकर्ता","इसके अलावा, सड़क पर काम करने वाले सेक्स वर्करों का तर्क है कि सीसीटीवी फुटेज का इस्तेमाल पुलिस अधिकारी उन्हें परेशान करने और उनके ग्राहकों से रिश्वत मांगने के लिए करते हैं। उनका सुझाव है कि पुलिस को सीसीटीवी का संवेदनशील तरीके से उपयोग करना सिखाया जाना चाहिए:","“हम यह नहीं कह रहे हैं कि अगर सीसीटीवी हटा दिया जाएगा, तो सुरक्षा बढ़ जाएगी। सीसीटीवी तो होना चाहिए लेकिन उसकी फुटेज का सही इस्तेमाल होना चाहिए। इसका इस्तेमाल गलत तरीके से किया जाता है। सीसीटीवी मत हटाओ, [पुलिस को] सिखाओ कि इसका उपयोग कैसे करना है।“","बिंदु,","3.  उत्तरजीवी (सरवाइवर) केंद्रित स्वास्थ्य देखभाल और परामर्श

देखभाल में मानसिक स्वास्थ्य सेवाएं भी शामिल हैं। हिंसा से बचकर आए लोगों को परामर्श के समर्थन के साथ स्वस्थ होने के लिए एक गोपनीय स्थान प्रदान किया जाना चाहिए। यह हिंसा से बचकर आए लोगों के लिए आश्रय गृहों में विशेष रूप से महत्वपूर्ण है, जो वर्तमान में परामर्श प्रदान करने के लिए खराब स्थिति में हैं:","“वहाँ एक विशेषज्ञ होना चाहिए। अगर आप 2000 रुपये खर्च करके एक काउंसलर नियुक्त करना चाहते हैं, तो

फिलहाल वह अपनी पढ़ाई जारी रख रही हैं। यानी वो अपनी सामान्य जिंदगी में लौट आई हैं। इसलिए, यह बहुत महत्वपूर्ण था कि उसकी बात सुनने के लिए कोई वहाँ मौजूद हो। अगर हिंसा से बचकर आए किसी भी व्यक्ति को यह
